# CB Supernova
Creation Bot Nova is a public test version of The Creation Hub's very own Creation Bot. It has very little non-meta commands, and is still being worked on, but is properly functional nonetheless. For more info on it's commands simply do `sn$help`. If you would like to suggest a command, use `sn$suggest`. The bot currently does not have much documentation, so please keep watch on this website for updates, add-ons, etc.

Its commands are easy and listed below.
