<h1>Rules</h1>

<h3>1. Spamming is Intolerable</h3>

<p>We have channels for this. #spam is open for all your processed canned meat needs.</p>

<h3>2. Respect Staff</h3>

<p>Really, respect all people in general. Even bots.. we want to stay on their good side :eyes:. If a user is being annoying either inside or outside of the server, don't hesitate to let us know and we will handle it for you, so you don't have to get your precious little hands dirty.</p>

<h3>3. Keep it PG-13</h3>

<p>This rule mainly applies to #üåélobby, though if you'd like to go all out we have #spam</p>

<h3>4. No Arguements</h3>

<p>This is what #fisticuffs is for. Duke it out there. Popcorn is supplied for spectators. üçø</p>

<h3>5. Stay on Topic</h3>

<p>In the lobby, we like to keep it clean, neat, and organized. We have janitors who check in every now and then. üëÄ @Staff. If you wanna go off topic and shit post and be wacky, we have #off-topic.</p>

<h3>6. Don't Randomly Ping People</h3>

<p>Randomly pinging users for no reason is really annoying, and will result in you being muted. Random pings make Dappy Pappy Unhappy üëÄ</p>

<h3>7. Keep NSFW Content in #nsfw</h3>

<p>We have an nsfw channel, though it is locked to members without a role. If you would like access, use c$role --nsfw, but staff are not responsible for underaged users having access, nor are we responsible for what is posted. Viewer discretion is advised, silence your cellphone and enjoy your movie.</p>
